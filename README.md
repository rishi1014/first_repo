Python Project 
File separator Project
This is my first basic project which i am pushing on Github which i made using python .
In this project the different types of files are merged into folders say for example if a folder has large number of files and you need to save them on the basis of there file type then doing it manually can be too much hectic and time wasting .
So i created this file separator project which will add files into designated folders.
Like all the file extensions having audio file extensions will be moved to the audio files folder similarly will happen with the video file extensions and document file extensions.
